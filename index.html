            <h1> Crime and justice</h1>

        <h2> What is Crime and Justice </h2>

        <p> Crime is any action that breaks a law, such as stealing, vandalism, or hurting someone.
 Laws are made to keep people safe and to help society run smoothly. 
 Justice is the idea of fairness and making sure people are treated equally when a crime happens. 
 It focuses on finding the truth and deciding what is right in each situation.
While crime describes the wrong act, justice describes how we deal with that wrong. 
 Together, they help keep order in our communities. </p>

<h2>How does Criminal justice works?</h2>
<p> The criminal justice system has three main parts that work together. 
The police investigate crimes, protect people, and arrest individuals who break the law.
The courts decide if a person is guilty or innocent by looking at evidence and hearing both sides.
Judges then give a fair punishment or solution based on the law.
Corrections include jails, prisons, and programs that help people change their behavior.
All three parts help keep society safe and make sure laws are followed. </p>
